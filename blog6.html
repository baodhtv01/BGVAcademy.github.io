      <i style="color: darkcyan;">Tuesday, August 13th, 2019</i><hr>
      <br>
      Parents always want their children to become talented in a certain field and always find ways for their children to develop their talents.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, many people have the perception that only children with language or math abilities are intelligent children, who do not know or recognize other children's abilities in the fields of art and sound. music, sports ...
      <br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is important that parents strive to discover and develop these potential children's abilities.
      <br><br><img src="images/imgblog6.1.jpg" alt="" class="centerimg"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Artistic ability can be revealed when a child is 3 years old. But for some children, this ability manifests later. Therefore, we need to monitor and check in each stage of child development. There is no universal formula for detecting a child's artistic abilities, but there are also some ability signs to look out for. For example, children always draw and often explain their drawings according to their own imagination. The picture describes in detail how children remember to have good observation of objects around them.
      <br>
      <br>
      Children always pay attention to colors, images, shapes and do not like others to change their "work". As for acting, it usually appears later, when the child is 6 to 8 years old. If your child is always trying to play a role and can please viewers, there is a potential for acting in your home. Children often pay attention to the viewers' attitudes and see if you have thoughts about their acting ability.
      <br>
      <br>
      Children will not be satisfied with their role if you do not applaud. In the sports field, genetic and physical factors play an important role. The bodies of good athletes match their sport. For example, most baseball players are taller than 1.8 meters. Most children run, jump or climb.
      <br>  
      <br>
      But if your child likes adventure or is good at these activities, then you probably have a sporting talent in the future. Talent in sports can be expressed in children up to 2 years old, depending on the strength of their body and how they walk.
      <br>
      <br>
      Talent can be natural, but to be successful it takes other matters, like training and development, or technology and discipline. Experts say that the best way to help children develop talents is to coordinate professional training and always motivate young people. Parents should encourage and show interest in activities that children enjoy. Comment on your child's artwork even though they don't make sense.
      <br>
      <br>
      Should take your children to the theater, to the theater because there are many performances suitable for children. Encourage your child to enjoy music by letting them listen to a variety of music and letting them learn about different instruments. The piano is the most popular and it is a good foundation for music learning. Respond honestly when your children ask you for comments about their performance. But remember that criticism should be constructive and you should always be ready to be a child's audience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Instead of forcing children to compensate for their tutoring, limiting sports and music activities that children like, parents should apply these activities to appropriate literacy. You will see your child achieve better results. Putting sports, music as recreational activities into the child's learning schedule will help reduce stress effectively.
      <br>
      <br>
      The results of the school intelligence and academic performance tests are not the only factor in assessing and detecting a child's intelligence ability. The ability to learn in school is just one of many factors that make up a child's talent and future success. Today, educators all agree that there is not only one kind of ability, but there are seven kinds of abilities that parents need to know so that they can coordinate to develop their talents and succeed in the future:
      <br>
      <br>
      Spatial Capability: Capable of perception of space, distance, altitude, time, size. Artists and architects need skills in these areas.
      <br>
      <br>
      Language, speech ability: Ability to express language clearly through speaking or writing.
      <br>
      <br>
      Math skills, reasoning: Good at numbers and problem solving. Along with language ability, this ability is considered a measure of a child's ability in school.
      <br>
      <br>
      Ability of body movements: Skills to perform body movements such as the movements performed by dancers and athletes.
      <br>
      <br>
    >Music ability.
      <br>
      Ability to communicate with people: The ability to understand and communicate with others including the ability to maintain relationships, inspire, and resolve conflicts. But great politicians, salesmen and teachers are strong at this ability.
      <br>
      <br>
      The ability to analyze, evaluate oneself and others: Know yourself well and have the ability to understand others. Psychological analysts are very strong in ability

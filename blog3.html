  <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">10 ways to teach smart children any parent can do</h2>
  <i style="color: darkcyan;">Tuesday, August 13th, 2019</i><hr>
  <br>

  The following simple ways will help parents raise a smart and healthy child.
  <h3>1. Interaction with your child</h3>
  Scientists have observed that children who are not cuddled, loved and played with 
  their parents have little brain development. They also find that children who are not cuddled 
  and are not receiving attention do not grow evenly, and often feel depressed or even fatal. On the 
  other hand, many studies have shown that interactions such as cuddling and playing with children help
   in intellectual development and have a strong influence on children. Loving connections and the interactions 
   that form between you and your child will provide a foundation for the development of thinking skills. <br>

  <h3>2. Talk to your child</h3>
  Talk to them and listen to what they say. This helps to reinforce communication and language. You can also
   read books to your child. Start reading to children even if they are not literate. This will lay the foundation
    for the development of language skills. Children who are read to by their parents from an early age have the ability 
    to develop a passion for reading, have good academic achievements in school and succeed in life as adults. Reading is
     one of the most important activities for raising an intelligent child.
  <h3>3. Balanced development of both left brain and right brain hemisphere</h3>
  The left hemisphere is responsible for language processing, abstract thinking, writing, calculating, organizing, 
  classifying, memorizing words and perception of time, and the right hemisphere is responsible for image processing.
   overall, spatial concept, visual discrimination, ability to perceive music, ability to imitate. The hemisphere must
    have the ability of holistic, synthetic, creative, subjective intuition, imagination, attitudes, feelings, and will
     of human. Although each side of the brain hemisphere has its own functions, they are always mutually reinforcing in
      the process of functioning.
  <br>
  Balanced development of both left brain and right brain hemisphere is one of the important principles for intellectual 
  development for children.
  <h3>4. Let the children have fun</h3>
  When children play, they are creating a foundation for the development of intellectual, social, physical and emotional 
  skills. When children are playing with other children, it is also the time for them to develop and learn skills to coordinate,
   combine ideas, attention and feel of others.
  <h3>5. Encourage your child to exercise</h3>
  Physical exercises not only make children healthy, but also help them develop intelligence. Exercises will help 
  regulate blood flow to the brain and regenerate brain cells. The exercise is good for the adult spirit and especially 
  for children, it also has a long-term effect on the development of the brain.
  <h3>6. Make music a part of your life</h3>
  Many studies have shown that listening to music can help children develop memory, concentration, 
  motivation and learning. Music also helps reduce stress - the cause of brain damage in children. 
  Learning how to play certain instruments also influences the brain's ability to think and make arguments - 
  this lays a good foundation for the development of abstract mathematics in the future. If possible, start 
  by having your child learn the piano. After reading the notes and playing 10 notes at the same time, children 
  will easily learn other instruments. But the most important thing is for children to learn to play musical 
  instruments early, no matter which instrument.

  <h3>7. Let your children observe and witness you doing creative things</h3>
  Children learn through imitating the actions of adults. If children see you sticking to books, writing or 
  doing creative work they will imitate and through it, gradually they will explore, discover and become smarter.
  <h3>8. Allow your child to play smart games on the computer</h3>
  Computer games can teach children about numbers, math, music, pronunciation, and more. These games also 
  help children develop hand-eye coordination skills and "train" them in skills related to computers and technology 
  in the future. More importantly, children can learn while playing. Learning while playing comfortably and happily 
  is the best way for children to acquire knowledge.
  <h3>9. Feed the child properly</h3>
  A proper food regimen is especially important in raising an intelligent child. Protein-rich diets such 
  as eggs, fish, meat, beans, peanuts ... will help improve children's attention, alertness and thinking. 
  Carbohydrates help provide energy for the brain to use during thinking. The richest source of carbohydrates
   you can find in whole grains and fruits. Processed carbohydrates and sugars have a negative effect on a child's 
   ability and concentration, so be mindful of this. Vitamins and minerals are also important.
  <h3>10. Take your child out</h3>
  Some good places you can take your baby to are museums and tourist attractions. 
  Taking children abroad at an affordable price is also a good option for them to
   discover new things.
